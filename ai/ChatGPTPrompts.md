## **Meteor.js-related prompts**

### **Deployment**

- I want to deploy Meteor.js app that I have in AWS Elastic Bean Stalk, and Dockerize the app(using `geoffreybooth/meteor-base` base image) and serve it in AWS ECR then automate the whole process of build and deployment using the GitLab CI/CD since my code is located at GitLab Repository. Can you show me high-level overview of the steps that I need to take?

- Let's start on number #1 how will I prepare my meteor.js app for deployment?
