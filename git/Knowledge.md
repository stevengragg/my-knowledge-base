# All about git


## Set my self as a verified author of commits (Well, I want to see my commit with verified badge its something nice 😂)



### In GitLab

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/


### Create GPG

```ssh

# Use this command for the default version of GPG, including
# Gpg4win on Windows, and most macOS versions:
gpg --gen-key

# Use this command for versions of GPG later than 2.1.17:
gpg --full-gen-key

```


### If you havee GPG, then check what is applicable

```ssh

gpg --list-secret-keys
```
